DetectColonies
==============

This program uses the depth-first search algorithm to search and sort through the colonies represented by numbers 0 to 9 in a text file located in a set directory configured by the user. It shows the results in a table-like format. Not very exciting, but really shows just one of the many things the Depth-First Search Algorithm can do!
